# DhanKanya

DhanKanya is a financial assistant that provides expert financial guidance, enhancing your financial literacy and addressing your needs. It is developed by the Finance team at 100GIGA and powered by Anthropicâ€™s Claude AI model.

## Installation

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If you are running a MacOS with an ARM chip (M series), PyAudio installation might fail. This is due to missing portaudio dependencies. To resolve this, follow these steps:

1. Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    ```

2. Install the portaudio package via Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install portaudio
    ```

3. Install PyAudio with additional build options:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install pyaudio --global-option="build_ext" --global-option="-I/opt/homebrew/include" --global-option="-L/opt/homebrew/lib"
    ```

Once these steps are completed, you should be able to run the application without issues.

## Usage

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
streamlit run dhanKanya.py
```
